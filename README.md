# Concentration
----
This is an implementation of a memory game I wrote in Java. It was originally a homework assignment for one of my programming classes.

##Todo/Issues
- After two mismatched "cards" are clicked, a one-second timer fires so that there is time to see the text/graphic each card has on it; otherwise, the cards would flip back instantaneously and it would be impossible to see the second card. If a third card is clicked on during this time, the game will pause permanently. This can only be fixed by starting a new game.
- Add general customizability (card face text/images, number of cards, number of rows/columns, etc.)
